# My-Mini-Projects-
# 🌟 My Mini Projects Collection

Welcome to my very first GitHub repository! 🎉  
This repo contains a collection of simple mini projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

These projects were created while learning and exploring front-end development concepts.  
Each one helped me improve my skills, understand DOM manipulation, and strengthen my JavaScript basics.
